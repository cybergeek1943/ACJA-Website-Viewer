![GitHub Workflow Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cybergeek1943/badges/main/build-passing.svg)


To download the executable [click here](https://github.com/cybergeek1943/ACJA-Website-Viewer/releases/download/v3.22/ACJA-Website-Viewer.exe).

Note - the core functionality of this really only works on windows since it uses cmd and powershell.

&emsp;

ACJA Website Viewer acts as a portal that opens up websites in kiosk mode so that the user does not have access to the URL bar or any other buttons. This was a small project I developed for a small local private school nearby.

This project is also sort of a showcase as to the kind of GUI/UX that can be made in an engine like Godot. It was a fun project to work on.

&emsp;

**Additional Tools Needed for best functionality:**
- Chrome - (In the future MS Edge may be supported as well).
- [smartKey Shortcuts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smartkey-shortcuts/aogbgmnbacmlobiajlmjhmbecjohglnl) - (chrome extension to make keyboard shortcuts exit kiosk mode and block other shortcuts.)
- [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-%E2%80%94-best-ad-blocker/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?hl=en) - (chrome extension to block adds.)
- [Alternate Navigation Buttons](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/alternate-navigation-butt/biojkleepjmhindklmdcomngjkcngjmb/related?hl=en-US) - (chrome extension that adds simple navigation buttons to go forward or backward.)
- You may also want to disable many keyboard shortcuts such as ctr+shift+esc, ctrl+n, win+r, or ctrl+alt+esc... as well as remove access to browsers from the start menu. 

There are may shortcomings of this program when it is run all by itself. In the future ACJA Website Viewer may be made kiosk itself and much more "kiosk" secure.
